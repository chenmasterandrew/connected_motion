## Method
This program performs multi robot task allocation (MRTA) for 5 robots using Sequential Auction. Each of the robots has a bidder node, and one of the robots has an auctioneer node. Each bidder node registers itself with the auctioneer node using the NewFollower service. As a result, the auctioneer holds references to all robots.

There are three pose_setter nodes, one associated with each robot. Each pose_setter node sends a message to the one broadcaster node containing that robot's initial pose. The broadcaster broadcasts this initial pose as a tf transform associated with the robot.

Once all the bidders have been registered with the auctioneer node, the auctioneer node sends a message to the /sr Start Randomize topic, which the randomizer node is subscribed to. The randomizer node takes a graph defined by the "nodes" and "edges" parameter in the launchfile, selects a random subset of the nodes and uses a steiner tree to get a steiner set of that node subset. The randomizer then publishes this steiner set as a Waypoints message to the /rw Random Waypoints topic, which the auctioneer is subscribed to. Once this happens, the auctioneer begins task allocation via sequential auction.

The auctioneer node sends to each bidder every waypoint as a Waypoints message via Auction actions. Each bidder makes a bid on each waypoint based on the cost formula 1/(distance + 1). The bids are then returned to the auctioneer via the Auction action. Once the auctioneer node receives all the bids, it performs sequential auction. While there remains unassigned waypoints or unassigned bidders, auctioneer finds the highest remaining bid and assigns the bidder to the waypoint as a winner. Each winning bidder is sent a waypoint to go to via the Allocate action. Once the bidder node receives this waypoint, it uses tf to convert this waypoint in world frame to the robot's frame. Then, it rotates in place and moves towards the converted waypoint.

## Evaluation
As shown in the video, this program works in the gazebo simulator. Bidders are correctly registered with the auctioneer node. Bidders will navigate to the waypoints for which they won the auction on and will move to those waypoints one bidder at a time. Steiner set is calculated correctly as shown in the print statements. However, depending on the movement speed/distance and turning speed/distance, robots may drift away from the waypoint coordinates. Sensible weights have been set in bidder nodes, and the program performs well with these parameters.
